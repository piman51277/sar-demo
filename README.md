# Sar Demo
A web-based simulation of Synthetic Aperature Radar and Backprojection.

See a live version [here](https://piman.dev/projects/sar-demo)

This project follows the [piman.dev project standard](https://github.com/piman51277/piman.dev/blob/master/projects.md), and generates code that is compatible with the piman.dev project loader.

> This was based off my work at the Beaver Works Summer Institute (BWSI), Unmannned Aerial Systems - Synthetic Aperature Radar (UAS-SAR) program. If you are a high school student interested in an intensive, hands-on engineering experience, please consider applying to BWSI.
